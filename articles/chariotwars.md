# Chariot Wars

<CalcEmulator :program="chariotwars"/>

Game [I made in 2016](https://www.planet-casio.com/Fr/programmes/programme3150-1-chariotwars-zezombye-jeux-actionsport.html) for a game jam with the Ancient Rome theme. Unfortunately, it couldn't compete with the masterpiece that was [Arena](https://www.planet-casio.com/Fr/programmes/programme3152-1-arena-lephenixnoir-jeux-add-ins.html) that straight up used a custom game engine with grayscale.

The main mechanic is button spamming `[EXE]` (Enter/Shift on PC) to push opponents. **The gauge in the bottom right must be in the middle for the push to work.**

Press `[EXIT]` (Space/Escape on PC) to restart a level.

There is a little surprise at the end :) and yes, this game is hard but doable :D
