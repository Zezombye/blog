# The Fundamentals: Things to ask at the start of a relationship

This is a concise summary of lists I’ve found on the internet as well as the very good book “[101 Questions To Ask Before You Get Engaged](https://www.amazon.com/101-Questions-Ask-Before-Engaged/dp/0736913947)”.

Except those questions are the kind of questions to ask at the start, not years down the line. Potential incompatibilities must be rooted out as early as possible.

Those are not “questions to get to know each other”, you can find that elsewhere on the internet. These are all things that could be dealbreakers or hard compromises, and at the very least that you and your partner must know about each other before deciding to commit to a relationship.

For the tests (political compass, attachment styles, etc) do them before the date if possible, and study what the results mean (what the libertarian/authoritarian axis is, or an avoidant attachment style.)

Try to make this not an interview but a “podcast date”. The questions provide topics as a starting point and the conversation will eventually drift off naturally, until it reaches the end and you continue with the next question. You’ll need multiple dates to get to the end of the list, and that’s fine. Just make sure to eventually answer all questions.

Some questions may be too sensitive to answer just yet, especially if you’ve just met. That’s also fine. Take note of these to answer later on when trust is built.

Also consider [36 questions that lead to love](/36-questions-that-lead-to-love.pdf) as a way of knowing each other. I recommend doing the very basics first (religion, children, relationships) with questions that have the highest probability of being dealbreakers while not being sensitive, then doing the 36 questions, then proceeding with the rest.
