# Refuting the moral ontological argument

The 

- No proof that good is the positive quality rather than evil (positive as in positive number of particles)
- Good and evil are defined as pleasure/pain, but those are qualities relative to humans, and not something inherent to the universe
- If someone does no good, he is not considered as evil; if someone does no evil, he is considered as good. Since the "neutral" position is good, then it is evil which is the "positive" quality. Or more accurately, both good and evil are positive qualities, but neutrality is still good or undefined (we wouldn't say a rock is good or evil). This would mean God is both maximally good and maximally evil, which might explain the absurdities in the Bible
