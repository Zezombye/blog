# Sokoban

<CalcEmulator :program="sokoban"/>

A good ol' sokoban I made in 2016, which was very handy during long math classes :D

You play as Pedro, a Mexican working at Amazon where he has to store large crates in designated spots. However, since the crates are heavy, **he cannot pull them** and must push them with all his strength. **He cannot push two crates at once.** Your goal is therefore to place the crates on their designated spots without blocking them in the corners.
