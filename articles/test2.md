The bits marked with `§blue§x`{hl} are then retrieved and concatenated together to form the final number. For example:
- The “ඞ” character is the number `0x0D9E`, which in binary is "`1101 1001 1110`{txt}".
- The UTF-8 binary representation of it is `1110§blue§0000 §reset§10§blue§110110 §reset§10§blue§011110`{hl}.
- The UTF-8 binary representation of it is `11100116515698468465165316359861698469846546516891681011110`{hl}.
- "$R=3$".
- $R=3$

Punctuation after math equations, such as $R = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6$, should not have line breaks.
