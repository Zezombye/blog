Translate this C code to Javascript. Be as faithful as possible; the aim is to be able to run a diff on the C code and the JS code and to see as few differences as possible. This means you should also not change comments and spacing whenever possible. For example, x+6 must not become x + 6. Comments must not be changed. The code has no bugs in it, so you must not change the behavior. If encountering a function or a constant that is not defined within the code, assume it is defined elsewhere, and do not create the definition yourself, it will be added later.
